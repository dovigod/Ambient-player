# Ambient Player
2022/09/26 ~ 2022/10/01 Nomad Coders music player challenge

As target user are developer and writer who usally spend much time sitting in front of desk
 I think the main objectives of this player is to reduce stress and enhance focus of user.
 So I tried to set the concept of this project as vinyl turn table that plays vinyl music, since  its  true that lofi musice actually meets project objectives and also ...
As a lover of Lofi & vinyl musics, I want to make this. Ah.. lack of logics..
